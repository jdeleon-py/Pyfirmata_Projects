This small project will combine the basics of Pyfirmata with the basics of Tkinter
to create a GUI that controls the output of an LED connected to an Arduino UNO.

The GUI will consist of two buttons ('ON' and 'OFF') that each control the state of the LED.

There are three files:
  - controller_functions.py creates the back-end functionality, where the computer communicates with the Arduino UNO
  - gui_interface.py creates the front-end environment where the user can interact with the Arduino UNO in real time
  - main.py is the file that is prompted in the command line that runs the combined front and back end.
